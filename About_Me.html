            <div>Many years ago, as a high school student, I found myself very good at understanding other people’s thoughts and feelings, predicting their behaviors under different circumstances. Then I started to playfully run some self-made experiments on my friends (without them knowing!) and comparing my predictions with their reactions and documenting them. I took a long journey from molecular biology to cognitive neuroscience, as I had realized I have more questions about human behaviors and their underlying mechanisms in the brain, rather than the molecular basis of neuronal function. </div><br>
            <div>Besides studying people’s brains, I love talk to them and draw them!</div>

          <div> I did my master thesis as part of a major study, concerning <i>"spatiotemporal neural dynamics of visual information processing in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease"</i>. During the study, participants went through two sessions of task-based neuroimaging (EEG & fMRI), each in a separate session taking a “rapid visual categorization” task <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-37709-x" target="_blank">(Khaligh-Razavi et al., Scientific Reports 2019)</a>. We were interested to see whether there is any difference in the level of activity and representation of objects in the brain of people with cognitive impairment compared to healthy controls. My primary responsibility in this project was to investigate the association between structural measures and behavioral data, and to highlight the brain functional differences among cognitive groups using univariate fMRI analysis.</div><br>
          <div>The results of my structural analysis was published in Alzheimer’s Association Annual Conference (AAIC 2020)<a href="https://vepimg.b8cdn.com/js/pdfjs/web/viewer.html?file=https://vepimg2.b8cdn.com/uploads/vjfnew/1101/posters/43552_%20Association%20between%20Integrated%20Cognitive%20Assessment%20(ICA)%20and%20Measures%20of%20Brain%20Structure%20in%20Mild%20Cognitive%20Impairment%20and%20Mild%20Alzheimer’s%20Disease.pdf#page=1&zoom=auto,-479,2238">[Link]</a>. Also, my manuscript regarding functional analysis is under preparation. </div>
