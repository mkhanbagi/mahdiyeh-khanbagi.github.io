        I have a B.Sc in Cell and Molecular Biology from the University of Tehran. During my bachelors, I
        realized that I have more questions about human behaviors and their underlying mechanisms in the brain, rather
        than just studying the molecular basis of neuronal function. Then I started my masters in Developmental Biology
        at the Brain
        and Cognitive Sciences Department at Royan Institute, and did my thesis as part of a study concerning <i>“Early
          diagnosis of dementia using task-based neuroimaging (fMRI), digital biomarkers and machine learning
          methods”</i>.

      <div>Every human being, begins with a single cell and through embryonic stages, develops different cell layers and
        organs, building a complete system for itself to thrive. The whole process of development is astonishing, but
        the amazing point is that the embryo builds a “thinking system” for itself (the “brain”), when it cannot even
        think!<br><br>

        When I was at high school , I found myself very good at understanding other people’s thoughts and
        feelings, predicting their behaviors under different circumstances. Then I started to playfully run some
        self-made experiments on my friends (without them knowing!) and comparing my predictions with their reactions
        and documenting them. I took a long journey from molecular biology to cognitive neuroscience, because I was
        fascinated by knowing how people understand each other, how do they collaborate together and how babies develop
        to build such
        understandings and collaborations. </div><br>
      <div>Besides studying people’s brains, I love talking to them, do portrait photography and sometimes.. draw them!

        <div> I did my master thesis as part of a major study, concerning <i>"spatiotemporal neural dynamics of visual
            information processing in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease"</i>. During the study, participants went
          through two sessions of task-based neuroimaging (EEG & fMRI), each in a separate session taking a “rapid
          visual
          categorization” task <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-37709-x"
            target="_blank">(Khaligh-Razavi et al., Scientific Reports 2019)</a>. We were interested to see whether
          there
          is any difference in the level of activity and representation of objects in the brain of people with cognitive
          impairment compared to healthy controls. My primary responsibility in this project was to investigate the
          association between structural measures and behavioral data, and to highlight the brain functional differences
          among cognitive groups using univariate fMRI analysis.</div><br>
        <div>The results of my structural analysis was published in Alzheimer’s Association Annual Conference (AAIC
          2020)<a
